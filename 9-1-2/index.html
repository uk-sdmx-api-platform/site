<p>Passenger and freight volumes are respectively measured in passenger-kilometres and tonne-kilometres, and broken down by mode of transport. For the purposes of monitoring this indicator, passenger-km data are split between aviation, road (broken down between passenger cars, buses and motorcycles) and rail, and tonne-km are split between aviation, road, rail and inland waterways. </p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>Aviation:</p>
<p>The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) through its Statistics Division has established standard methodologies and definitions to collect and report traffic (passenger and freight volume) data related to air transport. These standards and methodologies have been adopted by the 193 Member States of ICAO and also by the Industry stakeholders i.e. air carriers and airports. The data of ICAO is used by States and also the World Bank for its development indicators. ICAO uses Air Transport Reporting Forms A, AS, B and C to arrive at the passenger and freight volumes for air transport.</p>
<p>Precise definition of all different concepts and metadata related to Air Transport Reporting Forms A, AS, B and C to arrive at the passenger and freight volumes for air transport, as approved by the ICAO Statistics Division and Member States can be found at the ICAO website given below -</p>

<p><em>Martime</em></p>
<p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
<p>International maritime freight is an indicator reflecting (1) the sum of international freight volumes loaded (exports) and unloaded (imports) at ports worldwide and measured in metric tonnes, and (2) container port traffic at world ports measured in twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU).</p>
<p>Data is collected by the UNCTAD secretariat from various sources, including industry, government and specialised maritime transport data providers and consultancies. Volumes are expressed in metric tonnes and twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU).</p>
<p>As data on international maritime freight volumes are not widely available, only the data in tonnes (rather than tonne-km) and at the regional level are reported.</p>
<p>Data at country level are available for container port traffic measured in twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU).</p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>The UNCTAD secretariat collects and compiles the data from various websites and reports, including, by port and industry associations and authorities, national statistics offices, UN Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, governments, specialised agencies such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and British Petroleum (BP). Data is also collected from reports issued by maritime specialised sources such as Drewry Maritime Research (DMR), Clarksons Research Services (CRS), Dynamar, and Lloyd&#x2019;s List Intelligence (LLI).</p>
<p>Road, Rail, Inland waterways, Pipelines</p>
<p>The ITF and UNECE, in collaboration with Eurostat, collect data on rail and road, inland waterway and pipeline statistics on an annual basis from all their collective Member countries. Data are collected from Transport Ministries, statistical offices and other institution designated as official data source. Although there are clear definitions for all the terms used in this survey, countries might have different methodologies to calculate tonne-kilometres and passenger-kilometres. Methods could be based on traffic or mobility surveys, use very different sampling methods and estimating techniques which could affect the comparability of their statistics. </p>
<p>Official statistics for road, rail, inland waterways and pipeline transport are only available for UNECE or ITF member States. Data for these modes for other countries come from the ITF&#x2019;s global transport model.</p>
<p>For definitions of all relevant terms, the UNECE/ITF/Eurostat Glossary for Transport Statistics can be consulted. The 5<sup>th</sup> edition of this publication is available at https://unece.org/DAM/trans/main/wp6/pdfdocs/Glossary_for_Transport_Statistics_EN.pdf</p>

<p>ICAO is funded and directed by 193 national governments to support their diplomacy and cooperation in air transport as signatory states to the Chicago Convention (1944). Its core function is to maintain an administrative and expert bureaucracy (the ICAO Secretariat) supporting these diplomatic interactions, and to research new air transport policy and standardization innovations as directed and endorsed by governments through the ICAO Assembly, or by the ICAO Council which the assembly elects.</p>

<p>UNCTAD:</p>
<p>Established in 1964, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), published its annual Review of Maritime Transport for the first time in 1968. The publication is part of UNCTAD&apos;s research and analytical work in the field of maritime transport aimed at helping developing countries maximize their trade and investment opportunities and increase their participation in the world economy. It has been regularly reconfirmed in the quadrennial Ministerial Conferences, most recently by UNCTAD XIII in Doha (2012) and UNCTAD XIV in Nairobi (2016). The mandates emanating from these conferences have emphasized sustainable and resilient transport as priority action areas and established &#x201C;Sustainable and Climate Resilient Maritime Transport&#x201D; as an important thematic area n UNCTAD&#x2019;s work programme and the Review of Maritime Transport. </p>
<p>ITF:</p>
<p>The International Transport Forum (ITF) was created by Ministerial Declaration in Dublin in 2006 on the legal basis of the European Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT), itself established as an international organisation by treaty (Protocol) signed in Brussels on 17 October 1953. The objectives of the ITF are to serve as a global platform for discussion and prenegotiation of transport policy issues across all modes. Unique in its global and modal scope, the ITF works to foster a deeper understanding of the role of transport in economic growth, environmental sustainability and social inclusion. It aspires to raise the public profile of transport policy.</p>

Trans-border infrastructure development is best captured by passenger and freight volumes moved by Member States and Regions. A growth in passenger and freight volumes shows a robust infrastructure development happening in States and Regions along with the resultant socio-economic benefit. Air Transport is particularly important not only for the economic and job benefits but also because it is one of the only mode of transport that can be relied on during emergencies and disease outbreaks to reach food, medicines, medical personnel, vaccines and other supplies speedily to the affected persons in the affected areas. In addition, tracking how the non-road share of freight volumes, and the public transport share of passenger volumes, changes over time allows insights into the overall sustainability of the global transport system.</p>
<p><em>Aviation:</em></p>
<p>Informed decision-making is the foundation upon which successful businesses are built. In a fast-growing industry like aviation, planners and investors require the most comprehensive, up-to-date, and reliable data. ICAO&#x2019;s aviation data/statistics programme is to provide accurate, reliable and consistent aviation data so that States, international organizations, aviation industry, tourism and other stakeholders can make better projections. The UN recognized ICAO as the central agency responsible for the collection, analysis, publication, standardization, improvement and dissemination of statistics pertaining to civil aviation.</p>
<p><em>Maritime:</em></p>
<p>The volume of international maritime freight and container port traffic movements provide an overall indication of the importance of port infrastructure for trade and development and may be relied upon to infer the quality and adequacy of seaports and their hinterland connections. Maritime transport is the dominant mode of international freight transport when flows are measured in volume terms. Behind the global and regional headline estimates, individual contributions vary by region and type of cargo, reflecting, among other factors, differences in countries&#x2019; economic structures, composition of trade, urbanization, levels of development, extent of integration into global trading networks, degree of participation in global supply chains, and the quality of transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>World container port traffic reflects the importance of containerized trade and countries&#x2019; participation in global liner shipping networks and globalized manufacturing production processes.</p>

<p><u>Aviation data are broadly complete.</u></p>
<p><u>For inland transport statistics:</u> In case of missing data for a country for which at least one data point is available since 2000, we calculate estimates based on the expected growth rate for the country. The growth rates are computed from other socio-economic variables, such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population or urbanization.</p>
<p><u>For road, rail, and inland waterways:</u> For non-ITF/UNECE countries, countries that did not submit a response, or when there is uncertainty regarding the provided data, data points are estimated using the ITF models, which use several covariates such as GDP, population, transport network coverage and more. Currently there are four global models used for this analysis: the urban passenger model, the non-urban passenger model, the international freight model and the urban freight model. A description of the four models can be found in the ITF Transport Outlook 2021 or in the following resources.</p>

<p><em>Maritime:</em></p>
<p>International maritime freight: In case of missing data for a country or a sub-region for which a data point is available since 2006, UNCTAD makes an estimate based on the expected growth rate of the volume of merchandise trade. If not available, use is made of the latest year for which data was available.</p>
<p>Container port traffic: In case of missing data, UNCTAD makes an estimate by extrapolating from the liner shipping connectivity and ship capacity deployment data, which has shown to be highly correlated with container port traffic. Container ship deployment data are available for all container ships of the world, which thus allows for estimates on container port traffic to be generated even if no national data is available. In other cases, UNCTAD makes an estimate based on the expected growth rate of the volume of merchandise trade.</p>

<p>UNCTAD conducts annual checks of collected data by updating the data with latest data available and comparing the data for internal consistency, against previous years, or similar data published or produced by other sources, including commercial sources specialized maritime transport data providers and research entities. Correspondence is undertaken with countries when necessary to collect, compare or confirm relevant data.</p>
<p>Road/Rail/Inland waterways/Pipelines</p>
<p>The ITF and UNECE conduct annual checks of their jointly collected data, comparing the data for internal consistency, against previous years, and on a per capita basis across countries, to determine if the data appear reasonable. Significant correspondence is undertaken with the countries over potential errors, and common issues and challenges are discussed at both the ITF annual statistics meeting and the UNECE&#x2019;s annual Working Party on Transport Statistics.</p>
<p>A common problem for many countries is that passenger-km are only collected for public transport. Given that private passenger cars form the majority of passenger trips in most countries, this would clearly significantly underestimate road passenger-km, which is why the breakdown where available between passenger cars, buses and motorcycles is given. </p>
