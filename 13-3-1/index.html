<p>Indicator 4.7.1/12.8.1/13.3.1 measures the extent to which countries mainstream Global Citizenship Education (GCED) and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in their education systems. This is an indicator of characteristics of different aspects of education systems: education policies, curricula, teacher training and student assessment as reported by government officials, ideally following consultation with other government ministries, national human rights institutes, the education sector and civil society organizations. It measures what governments intend and not what is implemented in practice in schools and classrooms. </p>
<p>For each of the four components of the indicator (policies, curricula, teacher education, and student assessment), a number of criteria are measured, which are then combined to give a single score between zero and one for each component. (See methodology section for full details).</p>
<p>The indicator and its methodology have been reviewed and endorsed by UNESCO&#x2019;s <a href="http://tcg.uis.unesco.org/">Technical Cooperation Group on the Indicators for SDG 4-Education 2030</a> (TCG), which is responsible for the development and maintenance of the thematic indicator framework for the follow-up and review of SDG 4. The TCG also has an interest in education-related indicators in other SDGs, including global indicators 12.8.1 and 13.3.1. The TCG is composed of 38 regionally representative experts from UNESCO Member States (nominated by the respective geographic groups of UNESCO), as well as international partners, civil society, and the Co-Chair of the <a href="https://sdg4education2030.org/who-we-are">Education 2030 Steering Committee</a>. The <a href="http://uis.unesco.org/">UNESCO Institute for Statistics</a> acts as the Secretariat.</p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p><em>Global Citizenship Education (GCED) </em>and<em> Education for Sustainable Development (ESD)</em> nurture respect for all, build a sense of belonging to a common humanity, foster responsibility for a shared planet, and help learners become responsible and active global citizens and proactive contributors to a more peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, secure and sustainable world. They aim to empower learners of all ages to face and resolve local and global challenges and to take informed decisions and actions for environmental integrity, economic viability and a just society for present and future generations, while respecting cultural diversity.</p>

Students will not achieve the desired learning outcomes if Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) and Global Citizenship Education (GCED) have not been identified as priorities in education policies or laws, if curricula do not specifically include the themes and sub-themes of ESD and GCED, and if teachers are not trained to teach these topics across the curriculum. </p>
<p>This indicator aims to give a simple assessment of whether the basic infrastructure exists that would allow countries to deliver quality ESD and GCED to learners, to ensure their populations have adequate information on sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature. Appropriate education policies, curricula, teacher education, and student assessment are key aspects of national commitment and effort to implement GCED and ESD effectively and to provide a conducive learning environment.</p>
<p>Each component of the indicator is assessed on a scale of zero to one. The closer to one the value, the better mainstreamed are ESD and GCED in that component. By presenting results separately for each component, governments will be able to identify in which areas more efforts may be needed.</p>

<p>The following questions are used to calculate the policies component of the indicator:</p>
<p><em>A2: Please indicate which global citizenship education (GCED) and education for sustainable development) ESD themes are covered in national or sub-national <u>laws, legislation or legal frameworks</u> on education. </em></p>
<p>There are eight GCED/ESD themes (cultural diversity and tolerance, gender equality, human rights, peace and non-violence, climate change, environmental sustainability, human survival and well-being, and sustainable consumption and production) and two levels of government (national and sub-national) = 16 responses.</p>
<p>Response categories are no = 0, yes = 1, unknown, which is treated as zero, and not applicable, which is ignored. Blanks are also treated as zeros. </p>
<p>If more than half of responses are unknown or blank the question score is not calculated. </p>
<p>Note that &#x2018;not applicable&#x2019; is used where only one level of government is responsible for education.</p>
<p>Question score = simple mean of the 0 and 1 scores, <u>excluding not applicables </u>(i.e., if eight of the 16 responses are &#x2018;not applicable&#x2019;, the sum of the 0 and 1 scores is divided by 8 to get the mean and not by 16).</p>
<p><em>A4. Please indicate which GCED and ESD themes are covered in national or sub-national <u>education policies, frameworks or strategic objectives</u>.</em> </p>
<p>There are eight GCED/ESD themes (cultural diversity and tolerance, gender equality, human rights, peace and non-violence, climate change, environmental sustainability, human survival and well-being, and sustainable consumption and production) = 8 responses. </p>

<p>If more than half of responses are unknown or blank, the question score is not calculated.</p>
<p>Question score = simple mean of the 0 and 1 scores.</p>
<p><em>A5. Please indicate whether national or sub-national <u>education policies, frameworks or strategic objectives</u> on education provide a mandate to integrate GCED and ESD. </em></p>
<p>There are two levels of government (national, sub-national) and five areas of integration (curricula, learning objectives, textbooks, teacher education, and student assessment) = 10 responses. </p>
<p>Response categories are no = 0, yes = 1, unknown (treated as zero), and not applicable, which is ignored. Blanks are also treated as zeros. </p>
<p>If more than half of responses <u>excluding not applicables</u> are unknown or blank, the question score is not calculated. </p>
<p>Note that &#x2018;not applicable&#x2019; is used where only one level of government is responsible for education.</p>
<p>Question score = simple mean of the 0 and 1 scores, <u>excluding not applicables </u>(i.e., if five of the 10 responses are &#x2018;not applicable&#x2019;, the sum of the 0 and 1 scores is divided by 5 to get the mean and not by 10).</p>
<p><em>E1a.

<ol>
  <li><u>Student assessment</u></li>
</ol>
<p>The following questions are used to calculate the student assessment component of the indicator:</p>
<p><em>D2: Please indicate whether the global citizenship education (GCED) and education for sustainable development (ESD) themes below are generally included in <u>student assessments or examinations</u>.</em> </p>

<p>If more than half of responses are unknown or blank, the question score is not calculated.</p>
<p>Question score = simple mean of the 0 and 1 scores.</p>
<p><em>D3. Please indicate which of the dimensions of learning in GCED and ESD below are generally included in <u>student assessments or examinations</u>.</em> </p>

<p>Question score = half the simple mean of the 0, 1 and 2 scores, <u>excluding &#x2018;not applicables&#x2019; </u>(i.e., if one of the two responses is &#x2018;not applicable&#x2019;, the sum of the 0, 1 and 2 scores is divided by 2 to get half the mean and not by 4). The score is half the mean in order to ensure it lies between 0 and 1, as do the scores for the other three questions in this section.</p>
<p>Student assessment component score = simple mean of the scores for questions D2, D3 and E1d. Where component question score could not be calculated because too many responses were unknown or blank, the component score is not calculated and is reported as not available.</p>
<p>The component scores all lie between zero and one and are presented as a dashboard of four scores. They are not combined to create a single overall score for the indicator. The higher the score, the more GCED and ESD are mainstreamed in the given component. In this way, users can make a simple assessment in which component area more efforts may be needed. </p>

To assist with this, countries are asked to provide, in addition to completed questionnaires, supporting evidence of their responses in the form of documents or links (e.g. to education policies, laws, curricula, etc.). These will be made publicly available during 2022 along with completed questionnaires. UNESCO also takes into account alternative sources of information, where available. These may include national responses to similar intergovernmental consultation processes, such as the Council of Europe&#x2019;s consultations on the <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/edc/2016-report-analysis">Charter on Education for Democratic Citizenship and Human Rights Education</a>, the UN Economic Commission for Europe&#x2019;s consultations on the <a href="http://www.unece.org/env/esd/implementation.html">Strategy for Education for Sustainable Development</a>, or other information on education for sustainable development (ESD) and global citizenship education (GCED) in countries&#x2019; national education systems.</li>
  <li>Any proposed changes to response values in the questionnaire as a result of quality assurance procedures are communicated to and verified with countries by UNESCO. Final results are shared before publication by UNESCO with the national data providers and SDG indicator focal points. </li>
