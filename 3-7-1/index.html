            <dd><p>This indicator is linked to Target 3.8 (Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all) because the provision of family planning information and methods to all individuals who want to prevent pregnancy is an important component of achieving universal health coverage. </p>
<p>This indicator is also linked to Target 5.6 (Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights as agreed in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences) because meeting the demand for family planning is facilitated by increasing access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, and also improves sexual and reproductive health and the ability to exercise reproductive rights. </p>

<p>The percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) currently using a modern method of contraception among those who desire either to have no (additional) children or to postpone the next pregnancy. The indicator is also referred to as the demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong> </p>
<p>The percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods is also referred to as the proportion of demand satisfied by modern methods. The components of the indicator are contraceptive prevalence (any method and modern methods) and unmet need for family planning. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Contraceptive prevalence is the percentage of women who are currently using, or whose partner is currently using, at least one method of contraception, regardless of the method used. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For analytical purposes, contraceptive methods are often classified as either modern or traditional. Modern methods of contraception include female and male sterilization, the intra-uterine device (IUD), the implant, injectables, oral contraceptive pills, male and female condoms, vaginal barrier methods (including the diaphragm, cervical cap and spermicidal foam, jelly, cream and sponge), lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), emergency contraception and other modern methods not reported separately (e.g., the contraceptive patch or vaginal ring). Traditional methods of contraception include rhythm (e.g., fertility awareness-based methods, periodic abstinence), withdrawal and other traditional methods not reported separately. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unmet need for family planning is defined as the percentage of women of reproductive age who want to stop or delay childbearing but are not using any method of contraception. The standard definition of unmet need for family planning includes women who are fecund and sexually active in the numerator, and who report not wanting any (more) children, or who report wanting to delay the birth of their next child for at least two years or are undecided about the timing of the next birth, but who are not using any method of contraception. The numerator also includes pregnant women whose pregnancies were unwanted or mistimed at the time of conception; and postpartum amenorrheic women who are not using family planning and whose last birth was unwanted or mistimed. Further information on the operational definition of the unmet need for family planning, as well as survey questions and statistical programs needed to derive the indicator, can be found at the following website of the USAID Demographic and Health Surveys Program: <a href="http://measuredhs.com/Topics/Unmet-Need.cfm">http://measuredhs.com/Topics/Unmet-Need.cfm</a>. </p>

</td>
                <td><p>The proportion of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods is useful in assessing overall levels of coverage for family planning programmes and services. Access to and use of an effective means to prevent pregnancy helps enable women and their partners to exercise their rights to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information, education and means to do so. Meeting demand for family planning with modern methods also contributes to maternal and child health by preventing unintended pregnancies and closely spaced pregnancies, which are at higher risk for poor obstetrical outcomes. </p>
<p>Levels of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods of 75 percent or more are generally considered high, and values of 50 percent or less are generally considered as very low. The indicator has no global numerical &#x2018;target&#x2019; value set to be achieved by 2030. Looking at the highest values of the indicator, in 22 countries representing regions such as Europe and Northern America, Latin America and the Caribbean and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, more than 85 percent of women who want to avoid pregnancy are using a modern contraceptive method but for no country is this estimate above 91 percent. </p>
<p>Even in these countries, specific sub-populations (for example, adolescents or the poor) can still face barriers of access to family planning information and services. It should also be recognized that reaching 100 percent may not be a necessary or even desirable outcome with respect to reproductive rights. Some women may prefer to use a traditional method, even while having access to a full range of modern methods and being aware of the typical differences in effectiveness of methods in preventing pregnancies. Other women might have ambivalent preferences regarding their next pregnancy which may influence their contraceptive choice.</p>

</td>
                <td><p>Differences in the survey design and implementation, as well as differences in the way survey questionnaires are formulated and administered can affect the comparability of the data. The most common differences relate to the range of contraceptive methods included and the characteristics (age, sex, marital or union status) of the persons for whom contraceptive prevalence is estimated (base population). The time frame used to assess contraceptive prevalence can also vary. In most surveys there is no definition of what is meant by &#x201C;currently using&#x201D; a method of contraception. </p>
<p>In some surveys, the lack of probing questions, asked to ensure that the respondent understands the meaning of the different contraceptive methods, can result in an underestimation of contraceptive prevalence, in particular for traditional methods. Sampling variability can also be an issue, especially when contraceptive prevalence is measured for a specific subgroup (by age-group, level of educational attainment, place of residence, etc.) or when analysing trends over time. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When data on women aged 15 to 49 are not available, information for married or in-union women is reported. Illustrations of base populations that are sometimes presented are: married or in-union women aged 15-44, sexually active women (irrespective of marital status), or ever-married women. Notes in the data set indicate any differences between the data presented and the standard definitions of contraceptive prevalence or unmet need for family planning or where data pertain to populations that are not representative of women of reproductive age. </p>

<p>Country-level, model-based estimates are only used for computing regional and global averages and are not used for global SDG reporting of trends at the country level. However, the model-based estimates are recommended to be used for analytical and comparative purposes. Since the model takes into account the relationship of family planning indicators - contraceptive use of any, modern and traditional methods, unmet need for family planning &#x2013; the information from surveys that only provide data on contraceptive use (and have no information on unmet need for family planning) is considered as well. The model is providing estimates of the indicator for countries and years without direct survey data by extrapolating underlying trends determined using data across all countries. The model implicitly weights observations from other countries such that higher weights are given to observations from more similar countries. The fewer the number of observations for the country of interest, the more its estimates are driven by the experience of other countries, whereas for countries with many observations the results are determined to a greater extent by those empirical observations. </p>
