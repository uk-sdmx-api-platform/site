<p>This indicator measures the percentage of ever-partnered women and girls aged 15 years and older who have been subjected to physical, sexual, or psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner, in the previous 12 months. The definition of violence against women and girls (VAWG) and the forms of violence specified under this indicator are presented in the next section (Concepts).</p>
<p><u>NOTE</u>: References to &#x201C;violence against women&#x201D; (VAW) throughout also include adolescent girls (15-19 years old).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>According to the UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (1993), violence against women is &#x201C;Any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family [&#x2026;]&#x201D;. See here for the full definition: <a href="https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/48/104">https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/48/104</a> </p>
<p>Intimate partner violence (IPV) against women includes any abuse perpetrated by a current or former partner within the context of marriage, cohabitation, or any other formal or informal union.</p>
<p>The <u>different forms of violence</u> included in the indicator are defined as follows: </p>
<p>1. Physical violence consists of acts aimed at physically hurting the victim and include, but are not limited to acts like pushing, grabbing, twisting the arm, pulling hair, slapping, kicking, biting, hitting with a fist or object, trying to strangle or suffocate, burning or scalding on purpose, or threatening or attacking with some sort of weapon, gun or knife. </p>
<p>2. Sexual violence is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behaviour that is imposed on someone, whether by use of physical force, intimidation, or coercion. It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts (intercourse) without consent (rape or attempted rape), non-contact acts such as being forced to watch or participate in pornography, etc. In intimate partner relationships, sexual violence is commonly operationally defined in surveys as being physically forced to have sexual intercourse, having sexual intercourse out of fear for what the partner might do or through coercion, and/or being forced to do something sexual that the woman considers humiliating or degrading.</p>
<p>3. Psychological violence consists of any act that induces fear or emotional distress. It includes a range of behaviours that encompass acts of emotional abuse such as being frequently humiliated in public, intimidated or having things you care for destroyed, etc. These often coexist with acts of physical and sexual violence by intimate partners. In addition, surveys often measure controlling behaviours (e.g., being kept from seeing family or friends, or from seeking health care without permission). These are also considered acts of psychological abuse, although usually measured separately. . </p>

The organization produces estimates and statistics for a wide range of diseases and health conditions including in its annual world health statistics report. It has led work on the measurement of violence against women since 1998, developed and tested new instruments for measuring VAW cross-culturally, as well as ethical and safety standards for research on VAW. </p>
<p>In 2016, WHO Member States endorsed the <em>Global plan of action on strengthening the health system role in addressing violence, in particular against women and girls, and against children</em>(WHA Resolution 69.5) Improving the collection and use of data was one of its four strategic directions and included: a) Developing and disseminating harmonized indicators and measurement tools to support Member States in collecting standardized information on VAWG; b) Supporting Member States to implement population-based surveys on VAW; c) Building capacity in the collection, analysis and use of data; d) Regularly updating estimates of the prevalence of VAW.</p>
<p><strong>UNICEF</strong> is responsible for global monitoring and reporting on the wellbeing of children. It provides technical and financial assistance to the Member States to support their efforts to collect quality data on violence against children, including through the UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) household survey program. UNICEF develops standards, tools, and guidelines for data collection. Furthermore, it compiles statistics on violence to make internationally comparable datasets publicly available, and it analyses such data which are included in relevant publications, including in its flagship publication, <em>The State of the World&#x2019;s Children</em>.</p>
<p><strong>UN Women</strong> is committed through the conjunction of its triple mandate of normative support, UN coordination, and operational activities to work at the global, regional, and country-level to support the Member States in filling critical gaps in generating and using data, statistics, evidence, and analysis on gender equality in crucial areas. The organization supports the Member States in setting norms that include global standards. It conducts research, and compiles and provides evidence, including good practices and lessons learned, to inform intergovernmental debates and decisions; that help design specific policies and development plans at the regional, national, and local levels as part of its operational activities. It also assists in implementing norms and standards through its country programmes. In addition, UN Women leads and <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/how-we-work/un-system-coordination"><u>coordinates</u></a> the UN system&#x2019;s work in support of gender equality and the empowerment of women.</p>

</td>
                <td><p>Intimate partner violence is one of the most common forms of violence that women face globally. Given prevailing social norms that sanction male dominance over women, male violence towards their female intimate partners is often perceived as an ordinary/normal element of relationships in the context of marriage or other unions/relationships. Violence against women is an extreme manifestation of gender inequality and discrimination.</p>
<p>Prevalence data are required to measure the magnitude of the problem; understand the various forms of violence and their consequences; identify groups at high risk and explore the barriers to seeking help to ensure that the appropriate responses are being provided. These data are the starting point for informing laws, policies and developing effective responses and prevention programs. They also allow countries to monitor change over time and optimally target resources to maximize the effectiveness of interventions (especially in resource-constrained settings).</p>

                <td><p><u>Comparability:</u></p>
<p>The availability of comparable data remains a challenge in this area as many data collection efforts have relied on different survey methodologies, or used different definitions of partner or spousal violence and recall periods (e.g., different definitions of &#x201C;lifetime&#x201D;). Many survey measures and/or reports lack disaggregation by different forms of intimate partner violence (physical, sexual, psychological). There are often differences in survey question formulations and/or denominators e.g. all women [various age ranges], or only ever-married/partnered or currently married/partnered women). There is also heterogeneity in age groups sampled and reported on. The quality of interviewer training also likely varies, although this is difficult to quantify. Willingness to discuss experiences of violence and understanding of relevant concepts may also differ according to how the survey is implemented and the social/cultural context, and this can affect reported prevalence levels.</p>
<p>Given the wide variations in methodologies, measurement, and quality across studies from different countries, statistically adjusted estimates are currently needed to ensure comparability across countries and regions. However, generating estimates is an interim solution and individual countries need to collect robust, internationally comparable, high-quality data that reflect the relevant socio-economic, political and cultural risk, and protective factors associated with the prevalence of violence against women (VAW) to inform appropriate policy responses and programmatic decision-making. As more countries adopt international recommendations and guidelines, including the key elements described in this document, the need for adjustments for estimates for global monitoring will be greatly reduced.</p>
<p><u>Regularity of data production:</u></p>
<p>Since 2000, only about 78 countries have conducted more than one survey on VAW. Obtaining data on VAW is a costly and time-consuming exercise, whether they are obtained through stand-alone dedicated surveys or modules in other surveys. Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), the main source of data for low- and lower-middle Income Countries (LMICs), are conducted every 5 years or so and dedicated surveys, if repeated, are conducted usually with less periodicity than this. Monitoring this indicator with certain periodicity may be a challenge if sustained capacities are not built and financial resources are not available for regular surveys. At the same time prevalence is unlikely to change from year to year so, depending on resources, every 3-5 years is recommended.</p>
<p><u>Feasibility:</u></p>
<p>This indicator calls for global reporting on three types of intimate partner violence (IPV): physical, sexual, and psychological. While there is global consensus on how physical and sexual IPV are generally defined and measured, psychological partner violence&#x2014;is conceptualized differently across cultures and in different contexts. This indicator therefore currently reports on physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence only. Efforts are underway by custodian agencies to develop a global standard for measuring and reporting psychological IPV. This will enable reporting on the three stipulated types of partner violence in the future. </p>
<p>Similarly, this indicator calls for global reporting of violence ever-partnered women aged 15 years and above have been subjected to. Most data come from DHS, which typically sample only women aged 15-49, and there is a lack of consistency in the age range of sample populations across other country surveys. For those surveys that interview a sample of women from a different age group, the prevalence for the 15-49 age group is often published or can be calculated from available data. The global indicator therefore currently reports on both violence ever-partnered women 15-49 years of age and 15 years and older have been subjected to. Given the existing limited data availability on violence against women aged 50 years and older, efforts are underway by the custodian agencies to improve the measurement and encourage increased availability of data for women of this age group. This will enable a better estimation of the extent of this problem and understanding the experiences of partner violence for women over 50. </p>

<p>Number of ever-partnered women (aged 15 years and above) subjected to any act of physical violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women and girls (aged 15 years and above) in the population multiplied by 100 .</p>

<p>Number of ever-partnered women (aged 15 years and above) subjected to any act of sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women (aged 15 years and above) in the population multiplied by 100. </p>
<p><u>3. Psychological intimate partner violence: </u></p>
<p>Number of ever-partnered women (aged 15 years and above) subjected to psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women (aged 15 years and above) multiplied by 100. </p>
<p><u>4. Any form of physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence: </u></p>
<p>Number of ever-partnered women (aged 15 years and above) who experience physical and/or sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months divided by the number of ever-partnered women (aged 15 years and above) multiplied by 100.</p>
<p><u>5. Any form of physical, sexual and/or psychological intimate partner violence:</u></p>

                <td><p>The e estimates on physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence against women were based on the <em>Global Database on the Prevalence of Violence against Women</em> (housed at WHO). Studies included within this database were identified through a comprehensive systematic review of published global prevalence data, metadata repositories of national statistics offices and through the country consultation process as explained below. </p>
<p>Informed by international guidelines on the survey measurement of violence against women, including the <em>Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys</em> (UN, 2014) only population-based studies, representative at national or subnational level that used the &#x2018;gold standard&#x2019; act-specific measures of IPV were eligible for inclusion. This criterion aimed to minimise the under-estimation of the prevalence of IPV that is associated with the use of broader non-acts-based measures. Data extractions were conducted by two data analysts independently and underwent additional quality control and rigorous consistency checks by a third reviewer.</p>
<p>The United Nations Inter-Agency Working Group on Violence Against Women Estimation and Data (VAW-IAWGED) guided the process of developing the estimates and reviewed the Technical Note for the country consultation and published estimates&#x2019; report. The independent external Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to the VAW-IAWGED provided expert advice and input throughout the process of developing the methodology and the estimates.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, and in line with WHO&#x2019;s quality standards for data production and publication a formal country consultation process was conducted with 194 Member States and one territory (occupied Palestinian territory). The purpose this consultation process was to (i) to ensure that countries had the opportunity to review their national modelled intimate partner violence estimates and the data sources (surveys/studies) used in the production of these estimates; (ii) to ensure the inclusion of any additional surveys/studies that met these inclusion criteria but not been previously identified; and (iii) to familiarize countries with the statistical modelling approach used to derive the global, regional and national estimates.</p>

<p>Since 2000, 161 countries have conducted violence against women (VAW) national or subnational prevalence surveys or have included a module on VAW in a DHS or other national household surveys. However, not all these data are comparable and in many cases, they are not collected on a regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>
<p>Some countries (~77) have data on physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence for two or more time points. Global time series with comparable data are not yet available. </p>
<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>
<p>In addition to form of violence and age, income/wealth, education, ethnicity (including indigenous status), disability status, marital/partnership status, relationship with the perpetrator (i.e., current/former partner), geographic location, migration status, and frequency of violence are suggested as desired variables for disaggregation for this indicator. Though disaggregated data by these variables is not yet feasible to report on at regional and global levels, countries are encouraged to report these levels of disaggregation in their national reports; and&#x2014;whenever possible&#x2014;include these data for the age group 15 to 49.</p>

<p>All available survey data sources that are representative at the national and subnational level, are used to generate the prevalence estimates. The data are from published survey reports and/or data and datasets provided by countries. In cases where only data disaggregated by violence type were presented in the report, microdata was used to calculate the aggregate measure of physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence (IPV). As there is variability in the measurement across surveys and countries, relevant covariate adjustments were made to enhance comparability. These include adjustments for case definitions (e.g. severity), type of violence (i.e. physical IPV only or sexual IPV only), population surveyed (e.g. currently married women only or all women), reference partners (e.g. current/most recent partners), and geographical strata (rural or urban), aggregate measure of physical and/or sexual IPV where only one of the two forms were available.</p>
