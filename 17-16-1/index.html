<p>The indicator tracks the number of countries reporting progress in multi-stakeholder monitoring frameworks that track the implementation of development effectiveness commitments supporting the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs). </p>
<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>&#x201C;Multi-stakeholder development effectiveness monitoring frameworks&#x201D; that track effective development cooperation are monitoring frameworks: </p>
<p>&#x2022; whose indicators have been agreed on a voluntary basis; whose indicators measure the strength of the relationship between development actors; </p>
<p>&#x2022; where data collection and review are led by the countries themselves; and where participation in data collection and review involves relevant stakeholders representing, at minimum, the public sector, the private sector and civil society organizations.</p>
<p>The indicator takes into account the need to capture the respective roles and responsibilities of all parties involved in multi-stakeholder partnerships for development. It does so by looking at development effectiveness frameworks that are led by countries but include the participation of all relevant development partners. </p>
<p>The Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (Global Partnership) monitoring framework is an example of existing development effectiveness monitoring frameworks. There are other complementary efforts, such as the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Development Cooperation Forum (DCF) mutual accountability survey. Emerging and future monitoring frameworks that fit the above definition, such as recent efforts to track South-South Cooperation by the Ibero-American General Secretariat (SEGIB), could also be considered.</p>

<p>Reflecting the spirit of the global partnership for sustainable development, and the universal nature of the SDGs, the indicator monitors the contribution and behaviour of both provider and recipient countries in establishing more effective, inclusive multi-stakeholder partnerships to support and sustain the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.

<p>Countries providing and receiving development cooperation funding are invited to select whether they would like to report against provider-specific commitments, against recipient-specific commitments, or against both sets of commitments.</p>

Disaggregated results will show the detailed performance in each category. For the ultimate count of the number of countries making progress, dual countries are accounted as making progress if progress is made as recipient <strong>or</strong> as provider of development cooperation. </p>
<p>The baseline for assessing progress is the latest measurement available for each specific count When no baseline exists for a country, the first measurement available for an indicator constitutes the baseline for future measurements of progress.</p>

<p>Global aggregates are available for the 2016 and 2018 Global Partnership monitoring rounds. New data will be available after 2023. </p>
<p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>
<p>Data for countries have been compiled in 2016 and 2018. From 2023, data will be available on a rolling basis with all countries encouraged to report at least once within a four-year cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>
<p>The indicator presented as a global aggregate is generated through a bottom-up approach whereby data is collected at the country level and can therefore be disaggregated back at the level of countries (for both development cooperation providers and recipients) for national analysis and mutual dialogue. The data can also be further disaggregated according to individual indicators (i.e. specific dimensions of effective development cooperation) that are included within the multi-stakeholder frameworks.</p>
<p>To foster regional policy dialogue, disaggregation at the regional level is possible and encouraged. Some existing platforms are already using the evidence for regional monitoring, learning and policy discussions (e.g. NEPAD in Africa, the Asia-Pacific Development Effectiveness Facility in Asia-Pacific, the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, the UN Regional Economic Commissions). </p>
