          <dd><p>NTDs are formally recognized as targets for global action in SDG target 3.3, which calls to &#x201C;end the epidemics of ... neglected tropical diseases&#x201D; by 2030, as part of Goal 3 (Ensure healthy lives and ensure well-being for all at all ages). Successful interventions against NTDs contribute to meeting other SDGs, such as alleviating poverty (Goal 1) and hunger (Goal 2), enabling people to pursue an education (Goal 4) and lead productive working lives (Goal 8) and promoting equality, for example with regard to gender (Goals 5 and 10). Progress towards other Goals can accelerate the achievement of NTD goals. For example, wider provision of clean water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) (Goal 6) is believed to help to eliminate or control NTDs; the availability of resilient infrastructure (Goal 9) should facilitate delivery of medicines and outreach to remote communities; the goals of sustainable cities (Goal 11) and climate action (Goal 13) can support the environmental management necessary for control of disease vectors. Attaining all SDGs and NTD goals is founded on strong global partnerships (Goal 17).</p></dd>

<p>As part of global efforts to accelerate expansion of preventive chemotherapy for elimination and control of lymphatic filariasis (LF), schistosomiasis (SCH) and soil-transmitted helminthiases (STH), WHO facilitates the supply of the following medicines donated by the pharmaceutical industry: diethylcarbamazine citrate, albendazole, mebendazole, and praziquantel. WHO also collaborates to supply ivermectin for onchocerciasis (ONCHO) and LF elimination programmes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A joint mechanism and a set of forms have been developed to facilitate the process of application, review and reporting as well as to improve coordination and integration among different programmes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joint Request for Selected PC Medicines (JRSM) &#x2013; designed to assist countries in quantifying the number of tablets of the relevant medicines required to reach the planned target population and districts in a coordinated and integrated manner against multiple diseases during the year for which medicines are requested. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Joint Reporting Form (JRF) &#x2013; designed to assist countries in reporting annual progress on integrated and coordinated distribution of medicines across PC-NTDs in the reporting year in a standardized format. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>PC Epidemiological Data Reporting Form (EPIRF) &#x2013; designed to standardize national reporting of epidemiological data on LF, ONCHO, soil-transmitted helminthiases and SCH. National authorities are encouraged to complete this form and submit it to WHO on a yearly basis, together with the JRF. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The reports generated in the JRSM and in the JRF (SUMMARY worksheets) must be printed and signed by the NTD coordinator or a Ministry of Health representative to formally endorse the country&#x2019;s request for these medicines and the reported annual progress of the national programme(s). The date of signature must also be included. Once signatures have been obtained, the scanned copies of the two worksheets, together with the full Excel versions of the JRSM, the JRF and the EPIRF can be jointly submitted to WHO. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The forms are submitted to the WHO Representative of the concerned WHO Country office with electronic copies to <em><u>PC_JointForms@who.int</u></em> and the concerned Regional focal point, no later than 15 August of the year preceding the year for which medicines are intended to be used (e.g. at the latest by 15 August 2015 for implementation of preventive chemotherapy in 2016) but at least 6-8 months before the planned PC intervention(s) to allow time for reviewing and approval of the request, placing order, manufacturing PC medicines and shipment to the country. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>1) Average annual number of people requiring mass treatment known as PC for at least one PC-NTD (lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiases and trachoma). People may require PC for more than one PC-NTD. The number of people requiring PC is compared across the PC-NTDs, by age group and implementation unit (e.g. district). The largest number of people requiring PC is retained for each age group in each implementation unit. The total is considered to be a conservative estimate of the number of people requiring PC for at least one PC-NTD. Prevalence surveys determine when an NTD has been eliminated or controlled and PC can be stopped or reduced in frequency, such that the average annual number of people requiring PC is reduced. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2) Number of new cases requiring individual treatment and care for other NTDs: The number of new cases is based on country reports, whenever available, of new and known cases of Buruli ulcer, dengue, dracunculiasis, echinococcosis, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), leprosy, the leishmaniases, rabies and yaws. Where the number of people requiring and requesting surgery for PC-NTDs (e.g. trichiasis or hydrocele surgery) is reported, it can be added here. Similarly, new cases requiring and requesting rehabilitation (e.g. leprosy or lymphoedema) can be added whenever available. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Populations referred to under 1) and 2) may overlap; the sum would overestimate the total number of people requiring treatment and care. The maximum of 1) or 2) is therefore retained at the lowest common implementation unit and summed to get conservative country, regional and global aggregates. By 2030, improved co-endemicity data and models will validate the trends obtained using this simplified approach. </p></td>

Some adjustment is required to aggregate country-reported data on individual neglected tropical diseases across all NTDs included in this indicator.

<p>Following a recommendation by the Working Group on Monitoring and Evaluation of the Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for NTDs, WHO has led the development of an integrated NTD database to improve evidence-based planning and management of NTD programmes at the national and sub-national levels. The Integrated NTD database is available here: <u> https://www.who.int/teams/control-of-neglected-tropical-diseases/preventive-chemotherapy/integrated-ntd-database</u>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For NTDs requiring preventive chemotherapy, a joint reporting mechanism and set of reporting forms have been developed to facilitate the process of requesting donated medicines and reporting progress as well as to improve coordination and integration among programmes. More information is available here,<u> https://www.who.int/teams/control-of-neglected-tropical-diseases/preventive-chemotherapy/joint-application-package </u> </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>For the other NTDs, the number of new cases should be reported by the health facilities to the national level in order to compile them. If active case search activities are organized (e.g. for integrated skin NTDs, human African trypanosomiasis, etc.), the country must ensure that the number of new cases detected through these activities are also reported, either through the health facilities or directly to the national level. A strong health information system is essential for countries to be able to collect, compile and analyse good quality information on these NTDs.</p></td>

<p>Countries do not typically aggregate their data across NTDs, but if they applied the aggregation method as described above, they would obtain the same number. The only exceptions would be countries with one or more missing values for individual NTDs. In these exceptional cases, internationally estimated aggregates will be higher than country produced aggregates that assume missing values are nil. We present best estimates with uncertainty intervals to highlight those missing values that have a significant impact on country aggregates, until such time that missing values are reported. </p></td>
