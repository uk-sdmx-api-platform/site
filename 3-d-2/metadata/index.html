Antibiotics, antivirals, antiparasitic agents and antifungals are increasingly ineffective owing to resistance developed through their excessive or inappropriate use, with serious consequences for human and animal health (terrestrial and aquatic), and plant health, and negative impacts on food production, the environment and the global economy<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[2]</a></sup>. </p>\n<p>In particular, antimicrobial resistance will negatively impact the achievement of many of the targets listed under Goal 3 due to reduced treatment options for infections by resistant pathogens; will impact targets under Goal 2 by impacting the agricultural productivity, including food animal production; and will impact targets in Goal 1 as increased antimicrobial resistance will result in large declines in economic growth, increase economic inequality and drive an additional 24 million people into extreme poverty by 2030<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-ref-4\">[3]</a></sup>. </p>\n<p>Given the above context, there is an urgent need to build country capacity, especially in developing countries, to address this growing national and global multisectoral risk. The current indicator (3.d.1) for target 3.d has a focus on strengthening 13 core capacities &#x2013; essential public health capacity that State Parties are required to have in place throughout their territories pursuant to IHR (2005) requirements by the year 2012. While a few of these 13 core capacities<sup><a href=\"#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-ref-5\">[4]</a></sup> can be considered &#x201C;AMR-sensitive&#x201D;, they do not specifically monitor or address the significant risks associated with AMR. So, with the adoption of the Global Action Plan on AMR in 2015 by the World Health Assembly, the adoption of a Political Declaration on AMR at the high-level meeting of the UN General Assembly in 2016, and the report in 2019 of the Ad-hoc Inter-Agency Coordination Group established by the UN Secretary-General, an urgent need has been identified for an additional indicator on AMR to be considered for inclusion within the global SDG indicator framework. </p>\n<p>This new proposed indicator, based on establishing a functional national AMR surveillance system, is considered a basic building block for AMR monitoring and response in countries. Surveillance is the cornerstone to assessing the spread of AMR, providing early warning, and informing and monitoring the impact of local, national, and global risk reduction and management strategies. The global antimicrobial surveillance system (GLASS<sup><a href=\"#footnote-6\" id=\"footnote-ref-6\">[5]</a></sup>) managed by WHO recommends the establishment of three core components to set up a well-functioning national AMR surveillance system: 1) a National Coordinating Centre (NCC); 2) a National Reference Laboratory (NRL); and 3) Sentinel surveillance sites where both diagnostic and epidemiological data are collected. </p>\n<p>This new proposed indicator, therefore will help catalyse the establishment of national AMR surveillance systems to ensure the collection of data at the national level and can also be used for tracking progress of country capacity for early warning of outbreaks of resistant infections. The proposed indicator aims to address critical elements of the SDG target 3.d through a strategic approach derived from the evidence gathered through this indicator, as well as allows to &#x2018;strengthen the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries&#x2019;, &#x2018;reduction&#x2019; and &#x2018;management of national&#x2019; and &#x2018;global health risks&#x2019;, as part of the SDG global monitoring framework. The surveillance and diagnostics data thus generated will also help countries give early warning for public health preparedness, and for appropriate response measures. </p>\n<p><strong>Rationale for selecting the types of AMR organisms</strong>: </p>\n<p>(i) <em>E. coli</em> and <em>S. aureus</em> are among the most common human fast-growing bacteria causing acute human infections; </p>\n<p>(ii) <em>E. coli</em> is highly prevalent in both humans, animals and environment, being an ideal indicator for monitoring AMR across the sectors in line with the One Health approach. It recognizes that the health of humans, animals and ecosystems are interconnected and therefore requires a coordinated, collaborative, multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral approach to address potential or existing risks that originate at the animal-human-ecosystems interface; </p>\n<p>(iii) both MRSA and <em>E. coli</em> resistant to 3rd-generation cephalosporin are largely disseminated and found in high frequency in human infections observed in hospital settings all over the world and increasingly very frequent in the community. Infections with these types of AMR lead to increase in use of the last resort drugs (e.g., vancomycin for MRSA infections, and carbapenems for <em>E. coli</em> resistant to 3rd-generation cephalosporin) against which new types of AMR are emerging. </p>\n<p>Effective control of these two types of AMR will ultimately help preserve the capacity to treat infections with available antimicrobials while new prevention and treatment solutions can be developed.
